I dont in any way pretend to be an expert on kicad nor are these
complete designs, they are a bit hacked together, should be more Rs
and Cs on these boards at a minium.

Enjoy making my own modules as well, takes less time than having to
painfully edit the text, etc on the stock ones.

Some of these items were software created, not created using pcbnew,
checked with pcbnew then with oshpark's site which just uses gerbview
(checked with that too).  Built clock61, works great
